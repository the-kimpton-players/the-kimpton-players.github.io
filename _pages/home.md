We are a thriving amateur dramatic group based in Kimpton Village in North Hertfordshire.

The Kimpton Players is a registered charity and since its inception in 1943 has raised many thousands of pounds for local and national groups and charities.

We aim to put on three productions each year â€“ Old Time Music Hall in February/March, a play in June and either a play or a pantomime in November/December. We have also recorded some radio plays.
